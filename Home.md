Ktor is a framework for quickly creating web applications in Kotlin programming language with minimal effort.

This wiki provides a complete reference to the Ktor application structure, programing interface and 
how to approach particular tasks.

## Where to begin

The best place to start is with the [Getting Started](Getting-Started) tutorial. It shows you how to get an application up and running in no time. From there, you can then 
dig into the different areas. A recommended tour however would be:

* [Getting Started](Getting-Started)
* [Understanding the Application interface](Application)
* [Features](Features)
* [Hosting Options](Application-Hosting)
* [Structuring Applications](Application-Structure)
* [Testing Applications](Application-Testing)

Check our extensive list of [How To](howto/Home) topics to learn specific features and use cases.

## Advanced Topics

Once you've covered the basics, you can look at some of the [Advanced](Advanced) to understand how Ktor works under the covers and how you can extend it
with new functionality.
 
## Sample Projects

Ktor comes with a number of [sample projects](https://github.com/Kotlin/ktor/tree/master/ktor-samples), but if you 
want to see how Ktor is used in a real world project, check out some [Open Source Projects](Open-Source-Projects).
