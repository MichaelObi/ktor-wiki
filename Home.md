Provides a complete reference to the Ktor application structure, programing interface and how to approach particular tasks.

## Where to begin

This reference is designed for you to set up and run a Ktor application quickly. 
Start with [Getting Started](Getting-Started) and proceed to advanced topics as needed.
Check our extensive list of [How To](How-To) topics to learn specific features and use cases.

## Understanding Ktor
 
When you want to go deeper into Ktor mechanics, learn how to extend it, develop your own reusable installable features,
 provide transforms, or contribute to the main project, you will need to learn how it works. 
 
Start with the [Under the Hood](Under-the-Hood) topic, and then see [Advanced Topics](Advanced-Topics).
 
## Projects

Ktor comes with a number of [sample projects](https://github.com/Kotlin/ktor/tree/master/ktor-samples), but if you 
want to see how Ktor is used in a real world project, check out [Open Source Projects](Open-Source-Projects).
