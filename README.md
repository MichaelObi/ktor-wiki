[Ktor-wiki](https://github.com/Kotlin/ktor-wiki) repository is a mirror of the [Ktor wiki](https://github.com/Kotlin/ktor/wiki).

GitHub doesn't allow to send Pull Requests directly into Wiki repository of the project and thus collaborating
on documentation is not possible for non-committers. Ktor-wiki repository will be synced to the main Wiki repository
periodically as needed and allows managing documentation issues and collaborating on the content.
